        <h1>What is TEDx ?</h1>
        <p>
        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a 
        program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like 
        experience. Our event is called TEDx Birla Public School, where x = independently organized TED event. 
        At our TEDx Birla Public School event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep 
        discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance 
        for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
